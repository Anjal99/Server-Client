# Server-Client

Project: Simple Webserver using Python 3.7
Name: Anjal Parikh

The programming is created in python that implements a simple webserver from the user’s machine. 

Unzip the contents of the folder. The program would compile only if the following requirements were met. The user of this program is assumed to have a python IDE, pip and a python interpreter that are all in the user’s local directory. Additionally, the user must make sure to use a python version greater than 3.7 (preferably 3.7.7) and all the imported libraries must be installed on the local directory to avoid import errors. 

To run the following code, compile the server.py file and execute it into a python friendly environment. 

Once the server initiates, in a suitable web browser, run the following link http://localhost:’portname’/’filename

Replace the port name with the one mentioned by the user and the file name with index.html
